1. Phone battery is shown as battery melting down and as soon as our powerbank is plugged the cool, refreshing ice cream effect is made and the phone charges again (Stop the meltdown. Get a Scoop of Armor)
2. Choose which flavour of energy would your phone? Orange or Blueberry? (Give a treat to your phone with Armor Hue Hue Hue) (Social Media Interactive)
3. Ice cream or powerbank video (just like is it cake or fake videos) (Figuring out how to make ice cream look like powerbank is a menace)
4. ASMR dripping on plain powerbank (Ice Cream Scoop Melting) LMAO DED (i know you have already thought about it)
5. Apocalypse scenrio and the narrative says that we have to collect Emergency Rations and a Fat boy tells i need to get the armor scoop then people bash him saying yo uwant ice cream in this situation then we just reveal that scoop is a treat for our devices and a snack for them (Cringe but Okay)
6. Anti Brick Design Comparision Video with real brick and xiaomi powerbank (name masked obv) vs our powerbank
7. Mithilesh Rapid-Fire Quiz
8. Turn this in to a fashion utility showing it pairing up with different outfit (Outfit Of The Day kind of)
9. Bottomless Scoop illustration where the phone looks like an empty ice cream cone then used and drained then again charged and then again used and drained (Maybe 3 times) with conclusion "The treat that never runs out. Get 3 full charges from a single Scoop of Armor." 20k mAh can easily charge a 5k mAh phone 3 times at least if not we are selling a dabba powerbank tbh
10. Showing a confession of a weirdly described dream that my phone was charging with an ice cream then mithilesh wakes up and the Knight says its true here is Armor Scoop
